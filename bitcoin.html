    <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
    <TL:DR>Bitcoin is a digital currency that isn't controlled by any government, and it uses a special technology called blockchain to keep it secure and track transactions</TL:DR>
    <p>Bitcoin is like digital money that exists only on the internet. Imagine it as a virtual coin that you can use to buy things or trade with people, but instead of holding it in your hand, it's stored safely in a digital wallet on your computer or smartphone.</p>

    <p>What makes Bitcoin special is that it isn't controlled by any government or company. It's decentralized, which means no single person or institution regulates it. Instead, a technology called blockchain keeps track of all the transactions. Think of the blockchain as a big public ledger that records every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin. This makes it secure because it's really hard for anyone to cheat or fake transactions.</p>
        
    <p>People can get Bitcoin by buying it with regular money or sometimes by "mining" it. Mining isn't like digging in the ground; it's using powerful computers to solve complex math problems that verify and add transactions to the blockchain. As a reward for their work, miners sometimes get new Bitcoins.</p>
        
    <p>Remember, just like with regular money, the value of Bitcoin can change a lot. Its price goes up and down based on how many people want to buy it and how much they're willing to pay. Some folks see it as an investment, hoping its value will increase over time.</p>
